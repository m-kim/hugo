Some thoughts on OSMesa and VTK-m.

Ubuntu LTS 16.04.1 uses mesa 11.2.0. The version in Ubuntu (and apparently Fedora 18) 
isn't compiled with gallium. Therefore, it does not support GLSL higher than version 1.2.
 To get mesa (and by extension OSMesa) to run with a GLSL higher than version 1.2, 
we have to roll our own with gallium/llvmpipe.

Currently, if we default Ubuntu OSMesa and let it compile with VTK-m and libGL, there are no 
problems. However, swapping out a custom build libOSMesa results (for me) in a _glapi linker error. 
To get around that, I currently link Unittest_rendering_testing_osmesa by hand.
