What is a "pin-cell?" Profugus, a mini-app for CASL uses a CSG with Monte Carlo. 
Cool, but I need to know what a "pin-cell" is. Here's a google image search:

Here's what is in Profugus:

Here's the description from RTK_Cell.hh:

 * \class RTK_Cell
 * \brief Defines a single pin-cell geometry for MC transport.
 *
 * The following figure represents a pin-cell:
 * \image html pin_cell.png "Pin cell"
 * This pin cells has: \e 4-shells; \e 5-regions; \e 4-segments; and \e
 * 20-cells. The segments are indicated by the red-dashed lines.  The cell
 * indexing is:
 * \f[
   \mbox{cell\_index} = \mbox{region} + \mbox{segment}\times N_{r}
 * \f]
 * where \f$N_r\f$ is the number of regions.  The pin-cell construction is
 * constrained such that the number of regions per segment is always a
 * constant.  With these definitions, the number of cells in each pin-cell is:
 * \f[
   N_{c} = N_{r}\times N_{s}
 * \f]
 *
 * You can also specify gap on up to 2 sides of the pin, thus representing
 * assembly gap.  There are no explicit "gap" cells, the gap is just included
 * as extended moderator region on the appropriate side.  For example,
 * specifying a pin with pitch 1.26 with a gap on the right side of 0.1 would
 * return an "effective" pitch of 1.36 in the x-direction.  The pins are still
 * centered about x = 0.0:
 * \verbatim
    -0.63       0.0         0.73
      |          .           |
  left-edge    origin   right-edge
   \endverbatim
 *
 * The relationship between internal faces, regions, and cells is illustrated
 * in the following figure:
 * \image html pin_cell_test.png "Pin-cell faces, regions, and * cells."
 * The regions are indicated with blue ids, the faces are indicated with
 * red ids, and the cells each are given a separate color.  In this example
 * there are
 * - 4 regions
 * - 3 shells (with 3 faces)
 * - 4 segments (requiring 2 segment faces)
 * - 5 total internal faces (3 shell faces + 2 segment faces)
 * - 16 cells (4 segments times 4 regions)
 * .
 * See geometry/rtk/test/tstRTK_Cell.cc for a tracking example through this pin
 * cell configuration.
 *
 * There are 2 types of "special" pins: homogeneous and vessel.  Homogeneous
 * pins are simple boxes.  Vessel pins are homogeneous cells with a core
 * vessel bisecting it as shown below.
 * \image html core_vessel.png "Homogeneous and vessel pins."

Why do I care? How much CSG support is needed? Intersection, Union, etc?
