Continuing with the theme of "no progress," I got back on my nice desktop which allowed me to get work done.
So, I decided instead of integrating my raycaster into Profugus, that I would get Profugus to run on the GPU.
This was a week of frustration because, ultimately there are some partial specialization templates that 
don't play well with nvcc in CUDA 8.0.

Literally a week of wasted time setting that up. On the plus side I found out how to setup Trilinois for CUDA and 
MPI support, which is nice.

[Building with CUDA Support] (https://trilinos.org/about/documentation/building-with-cuda-support/). 
This is a nice explanation of how to do it. Note, Trilinos doesn't seem to have the nvcc_wrapper, which 
can be found [here.](https://github.com/kokkos/nvcc_wrapper).

Also, I was able to install hyper-v on my laptop, so I can do linux development on it. No more MINGw.
