Integrating Profugus and VTK-m is the same pain as anything else. I don't know what anything means. That's both in the conceptual sense and in the code itself as well. 

On that note though, I found a matlab repository, [MATLAB-Transport-Pack](https://github.com/robertsj/MATLAB-Transport-Pack)
that uses the same example as packages/MC/examples/mc-c5g7.xml. So, I'll be taking
a look at that repository as well for thoughts.

Edit:

c5g7 might be a [standard benchmark in the field](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/223050690_fig3_Fig-3-Unrodded-3-D-Extension-C5G7-geometry-and-materials).
