Integrating Profugus and VTK-m is the same pain as anything else. I don't know what anything means. That's both in the conceptual sense and in the code itself as well. 

On that note though, I found a matlab repository, [MATLAB-Transport-Pack](https://github.com/robertsj/MATLAB-Transport-Pack)
that uses the same example as packages/MC/examples/mc-c5g7.xml. So, I'll be taking
a look at that repository as well for thoughts.
