[Visual Studio 2017 was released this week](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/20-years-in-the-making-visual-studio-2017-is-faster-leaner-devops-ier/) and I 
discovered today that CMake is built in. O.o That's pretty awesome since I've been using CMake for almost a decade now.

But, how easy is it to use? Well, since I don't know json, the curve is pretty high for me. I decided to see if I can get [VTK-m](http://m.vtk.org/index.php/Main_Page) 
to natively work with VS2017. I would have tried [Profugus](https://github.com/ORNL-CEES/Profugus), but I use an install script for VTK-m integration and I've
only got QT Creator to open the project once it's been generated.

First, open the folder:
![open folder](/images/2017/03/09/file-folder-dialog.png)

Cool! It builds a solution.

Well, what now? Generate the cache:
![generate cache](/images/2017/03/09/generate-cache.png)

There are problems though. In particular, couldn't find some rendering libraries/header files. 
![missing libs](/images/2017/03/09/problems.png)

Let's take a look at the CMakeSettings.json:
![CmakeSettings.json](/images/2017/03/09/change-cmake-settings.png)

VS2017 generates 4 configurations: x86-Debug, x86-Release, x64-Debug, x64-Release. [Microsoft has an explanation for the settings](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/10/05/cmake-support-in-visual-studio/) which is good because the default
configurations don't have the one thing we need: "variable."
![CMakeSettings](/images/2017/03/09/cmakesettings.png)

I want to resolve glut and glew, which requires changing the CMakeSettings.json. Previously, one configuration for x64-debug would look like this:
`
{
    "name": "x64-Debug",
    "generator": "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64",
    "configurationType" : "Debug",
    "buildRoot":  "${env.LOCALAPPDATA}\\CMakeBuild\\${workspaceHash}\\build\\${name}",
    "cmakeCommandArgs":  "",
    "buildCommandArgs": "-m -v:minimal"
},
`

But, I keep my glew and glut in strange places and they are static builds. So, to indicate a static build, I need to add *-DFREEGLUT_STATIC* and *-DGLEW_STATIC*
to the CMake variable **CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.** We can see this in the "variables" configuration name. The variables ["contains a name+value pair of CMake variables that will get passed as -Dname=value to CMake."](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/10/05/cmake-support-in-visual-studio/#configure-cmake). So, we can also set GLEW_LIBRARY, GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR, GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR and GLUT_glut_LIBRARY. Note though, this is per configuration (x86-Debug, x64-Release, etc...). 

`
{
    "name": "x64-Debug",
    "generator": "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64",
    "configurationType" : "Debug",
    "buildRoot":  "${env.LOCALAPPDATA}\\CMakeBuild\\${workspaceHash}\\build\\${name}",
    "cmakeCommandArgs":  "",
    "buildCommandArgs": "-m -v:minimal"
    "variables": [
        {
        "name": "GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR",
        "value": "C:\\Users\\mark\\render\\tools\\glew\\include"
        },
        {
        "name": "GLEW_LIBRARY",
        "value": "C:\\Users\\mark\\render\\lib"
        },
        {
        "name": "CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS",
        "value": "-DFREEGLUT_STATIC -DGLEW_STATIC"
        },
        {
        "name": "GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR",
        "value": "C:\\Users\\mark\\render\\tools\\freeglut"
        },
        {
        "name": "GLUT_glut_LIBRARY",
        "value": "C:\\Users\\mark\\render\\lib"
        }
    ]
}
`

Run "Generate Cache" again from the CMake menu dropdown and glew and glut are found:

As nice as it is to have CMake integrated into Visual Studio, variable exploration is difficult. ccmake and cmake-gui 
lay out the variables nicely for you. Yes, it can be overwhelming, but it's at least exploratory.
