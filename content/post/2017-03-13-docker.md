[Eric](https://github.com/suchyta1) mentioned he uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as part of his dev environment. 
So, I thought I'd give it a whirl.

First problem encountered: setting up the environment was a problem because I couldn't run apt-get. Initially I thought it 
was a repo problem, so I switched to a more local one. Nope. Ended up being a DNS problem, which required a [fix](https://robinwinslow.uk/2016/06/23/fix-docker-networking-dns/#the-quick-fix-overriding-docker-39-s-dns).

~~~~
$ nmcli dev show | grep 'IP4.DNS'
~~~~

Then, run docker with the return value from nmcli:

~~~~
docker run --dns x.x.x.x demo-base ping google.com
PING google.com (172.217.5.238) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from iad30s07-in-f238.1e100.net (172.217.5.238): icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=20.2 ms
64 bytes from iad30s07-in-f238.1e100.net (172.217.5.238): icmp_seq=2 ttl=52 time=20.0 ms

Update daemon.json in /etc/docker:

~~~~
{
    "dns": ["x.x.x.23", "x.x.x.28"]
}
~~~~

Thanks to [Robin Winslow](https://robinwinslow.uk/2016/06/23/fix-docker-networking-dns/#the-quick-fix-overriding-docker-39-s-dns) for the very easy to follow tutorial on how to fix this!
