I think DS uses ADIOS 1.9.0. Which doesn't want to compile properly with 16.04 (gcc 5.4). So, Docker makes even more sense than before. 
So, I created a simple dev-env, which then gets adios-1.9.0, copies DS over from the host and compiles and install everything in one swoop.

So, how do I develop in the container? With my usual pipeline, QtCreator. Problem: how do we run a GUI in a docker?

~~~~
docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix dev-env
~~~~

But wait, I still have problems. Running qtcreator in this environment stalls with:

~~~~
Starting process:  "/usr/bin/cmake" "--help" 
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
Unrecognized OpenGL version
Unrecognized OpenGL version
~~~~

Which is fine for my purposes. In the past, I know that GL is used on the Welcome screen, so how about,

~~~~
qtcreator -noload Welcome
~~~~

which only spits out:

~~~~
Starting process:  "/usr/bin/cmake" "--help" 
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
Starting process:  "/usr/bin/cmake" "--help-command-list" 
Starting process:  "/usr/bin/cmake" "--help-commands" 
Starting process:  "/usr/bin/cmake" "--help-property-list" 
Starting process:  "/usr/bin/cmake" "--help-variable-list"
~~~~


And now I have qtcreator running in my Docker container.
