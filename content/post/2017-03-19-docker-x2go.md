Previously, to run qtcreator from a docker I ran a container with these settings:

~~~~
docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix adios_vtk
~~~~
and then executed qtcreator from another terminal:

~~~~
docker exec youthful_bassi qtcreator -noload Welcome
~~~~

However, with x2go, there's yet another wrinkle to the problem. Initially trying to run qtcreator 
x2go I would get an DISPLAY error. I don't know why I was getting this problem when I didn't have it previously on a local X window. 
After some trial and error, I [discovered](http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2014/09/11/running-gui-apps-with-docker/) (see "easeway" comment) I needed 
to pass my Xauthority into the docker when the container launched.

docker run -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-univ -v /home/mkim/.Xauthority:/home/mark/.Xauthority --net=host adios_vtk
